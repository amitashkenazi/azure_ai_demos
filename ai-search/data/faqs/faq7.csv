question,answer
Can I skip the 30 days and just start with pay-as-you-go pricing?,"Yes. You can sign up directly for pay as you go. This will enable you to immediately use services beyond the free amounts at pay-as-you-go rates. You'll still get monthly free amounts of popular services for 12 months and more than 55 services that are always free, but you won't receive the $200 credit."
