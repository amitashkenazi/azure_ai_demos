"What is platform support, and what does it include?","Platform support is a reduced support plan for unsupported 'N-3' version clusters. Platform support only includes Azure infrastructure support. Platform support doesn't include anything related to the following: Kubernetes functionality and components, Cluster or node pool creation, Hotfixes, Bug fixes, Security patches, Retired components. For more information on restrictions, see the platform support policy. AKS relies on the releases and patches from Kubernetes, which is an Open Source project that only supports a sliding window of three minor versions. AKS can only guarantee full support while those versions are being serviced upstream. Since there's no more patches being produced upstream, AKS can either leave those versions unpatched or fork. Due to this limitation, platform support doesn't support anything from relying on kubernetes upstream."
