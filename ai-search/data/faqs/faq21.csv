What's the size limit on a container image in AKS?,"AKS doesn't set a limit on the container image size. However, it's important to understand that the larger the image, the higher the memory demand. A larger size could potentially exceed resource limits or the overall available memory of worker nodes. By default, memory for VM size Standard_DS2_v2 for an AKS cluster is set to 7 GiB.\n\nWhen a container image is excessively large, as in the Terabyte (TBs) range, kubelet might not be able to pull it from your container registry to a node due to lack of disk space."
