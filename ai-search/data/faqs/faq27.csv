Why is my cluster delete taking so long?,"Most clusters are deleted upon user request. In some cases, especially cases where you bring your own Resource Group or perform cross-RG tasks, deletion can take more time or even fail. If you have an issue with deletes, double-check that you don't have locks on the RG, that any resources outside of the RG are disassociated from the RG, and so on."
