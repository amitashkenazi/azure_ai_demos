What happens to my unused credit if I upgrade before the end of 30 days?,"If you move to pay-as-you-go pricing before the end of 30 days, you wonâ€™t lose your credit. When you move to pay as you go, any credit you have remaining will still be available for the full 30 days from when you created your free account."
