Do I have to pay something after 30 days or after I use up my credit?,"At the end of your first 30 days or after you spend your $200 credit (whichever comes first), we'll ask you if you want to move to pay-as-you-go pricing. If you move to pay as you go, you'll keep getting free services and you'll only pay for what you use beyond the free monthly amounts. If you don't move to pay as you go, you can't purchase Azure services beyond your $200 creditâ€”and eventually your account and services will be disabled."
