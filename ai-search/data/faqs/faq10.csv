What happens with the services if I donâ€™t move to pay as you go?,"If you decide not to move to pay-as-you-go pricing after your first 30 days or once you've used up your $200 credit (whichever happens first), any services you've deployed will be decommissioned and you won't be able to access them. To regain access, move to pay as you go within the following 30 days."
