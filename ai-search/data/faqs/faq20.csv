Are security updates applied to AKS agent nodes?,"AKS patches CVEs that have a 'vendor fix' every week. CVEs without a fix are waiting on a 'vendor fix' before it can be remediated. The AKS images are automatically updated inside of 30 days. We recommend you apply an updated Node Image on a regular cadence to ensure that latest patched images and OS patches are all applied and current. You can do this using one of the following methods:\n\nManually, through the Azure portal or the Azure CLI.\nBy upgrading your AKS cluster. The cluster upgrades cordon and drain nodes automatically and then bring a new node online with the latest Ubuntu image and a new patch version or a minor Kubernetes version. For more information, see Upgrade an AKS cluster.\nBy using node image upgrade."
