How do I get the 55+ other services that are always free?,"You start getting monthly free amounts of more than 55 other services when you create your Azure free account. If you move to pay-as-you-go pricing after 30 days or after you use your credit, you’ll continue to receive monthly free amounts of these services. If you exceed your monthly free amounts for any of these services, you’ll be billed for them at pay-as-you-go rates."
