Does AKS automatically upgrade my unsupported clusters?,"AKS initiates auto-upgrades for unsupported clusters. When a cluster in an n-3 version (where n is the latest supported AKS GA minor version) is about to drop to n-4, AKS automatically upgrades the cluster to n-2 to remain in an AKS support policy. Automatically upgrading a platform supported cluster to a supported version is enabled by default. For example, kubernetes v1.25 upgrades to v1.26 during the v1.29 GA release. To minimize disruptions, set up maintenance windows. See auto-upgrade for details on automatic upgrade channels."
